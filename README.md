## INSPIRATION
In a world where the rate of deforestation in this world is much greater than the rate at which forestation is taking place which also makes it difficult for animals to live in their natural habitat.

## WHAT IT DOES
PlanetTree is a webapp that visualizes forest cover change over a period of time. There are 3 modes of data visualization

1. Total Forest Cover
2. Forest Gain
3. Forest Loss

## CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO
One challenge we ran into was that there was not processed/usable dataset available to be feed into the system. The only data source available was satellite pictures. We configured the satellite images and used algorithms to extract information.We are very proud that we were able to create an aesthetically pleasing, workable, and easy to use app during this hackathon.

## WHAT'S NEXT FOR PLANETTREE
A device that used ML to detect machinery such as chainsaw real time and the alert officials.
